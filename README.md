### Architecture Information:
	
 Inspired by the success of my curriculum a few years past, I chose a simple  dual column style.The primary goal is to allow users like Mr. Jamison to quickly see both my qualifications and personal characteristics.

Right column: 
Occupying about two thirds of the page, will be centered around  
tangible accomplishments and strengths.
 - work experience: with the position occupied, a brief description of it, and the company I worked for. 

-Skills and programming languages: I know  a user such as mr. Jamison will not know the names of the languages but 
will at least get a glimplse of  my breadth of experience with learning new programming languages.This section will help complement my rather short work experience. 

-Educational background: The institution I studied in and the degree I acquired or am in the process of acquiring.

-Languages:languages I know and my level of proficiency with them.
Left column:
It will occupy the remaining third, will  have information pertaining to more personal matters

-About me:A short description to provide insight into my motivations, attitudes, and professional outlook.It will include my name and a photograph

-Hobbies:of hobbies to complement the ‘About Me’ section, helping the reader understand my interests and personality beyond work.

 -Contact information:Phone number, address and email.


### Visual design:
For this CV web, I geared the visual design towards a modern and clean, though aesthetically pleasing look, aiming to make a straightforward experience for users like Mr.Jamison who appreciate, besides pictures of that damn spider, simplicity and transparency. It was inspired by, first of all my choice of color and the cv design I used on my previous one, which worked after all.
Color Palette:
I used the same method I use to paint miniatures, I chose a color I really liked to use, teal in this case and I tried to complement it. I use a mostly subdued palette, using bright colors only for titles to catch the eye, to convey that clean professional and modern look I want and help its legibility.

-Sidebar: Bold blue provides a strong contrast between the right and left columns, making it easy to distinguish between personal and  other information

-Sidebar titles: Teal. I honestly just liked how it made the titles on this column pop and was the main inspiration for the choice of other colors.

-Sidebar text:Grey. I found outright white to be too much on the eye on bold blue so I dialed it back until it felt more pleasing alongside it and the teal

-Main background: white with alternating  light grey sections to help the eye differentiate between said sections 

-Main font color: black. A classic black and white, nothing more to add.
-Main title color: Muted orange. The moment I chose teal I knew I had to use orange somewhere and using it against white created a good parallel to the teal titles against blue.

Typography:
I am honestly bad at differentiating fonts so I  just chose arial. Nice, simple and standard.

Layout:
	As I  stated earlier, the design is inspired by my earlier CV and many other such templates I have seen.
